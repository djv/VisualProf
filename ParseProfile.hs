-- This module parses the profile file generated when a program is run
-- with the +RTS -px -RTS flag.  The result is a Profile record that
-- contains all of the information from the file.
--
-- Although it does not describe the exact format output when using the
-- +RTS -px -RTS flag, the best reference on the cost center stack accounting
-- scheme is
--
--        Morgan, R.G. and S.A. Jarvis, "Profiling large-scale lazy
--            functional programs", J. Functional Prog 8 (3), 1998,
--            pp. 201 - 237.
-- 
-- The format of the profile file generated when using the "-px" flag:
--
-- The first line is a quoted string giving the time of day when the
-- profile was generated:
--
--        <timestamp>
--
-- The second line is a quoted string giving the sampling interval, e.g.,
-- "20 ms":
--
--        <tick interval>
--
-- The profiling data begins with lines listing the names of all the cost
-- centers, and the module to which each belongs. Each line begins with
-- a literal '1':
--
--        1 <cost center number> <cost center name> <module name>
--
-- The <cost center number> is a integer, the <cost center name> and
-- <module name> are quoted strings.
--
-- The call tree itself is given by lines beginning with a literal '2'.
-- Each line looks like:
--
--        2 <cost center stack code> <root code> <cost center number> <parent node>
--
-- The <cost center stack code> is identifies the stack to which this
-- <cost center number> belongs.  The <root code> is a literal '1' if this
-- cost center is the root of the call tree, a literal '2' otherwise.
-- The <parent node> is the cost center stack code of the parent of this
-- cost center.  If the <root code> is '1' the <parent node> field is
-- absent.  The <cost center stack code>, <cost center number> and
-- <parent node> are all integers.
--
-- One important thing to note is that multiple lines can have the same
-- <cost center stack code>.  Only the first entry contains cost accounting
-- data.  The other lines with the same <cost center stack code> are "back edges",
-- used internally by the run time system to efficiently navigate the
-- cost center stack graph, but not containing any additional accounting
-- information.
--
-- The final line of the file contains all of the actual profiling data.
-- The format is:
--
--        5 <total ticks> {1 <cost center stack code> <call count> <tick count> <alloc count>}+ 0
--
-- where the expression in curly braces is repeated for all of the
-- cost center stack codes.  Each cost reports for <cost center stack code>
-- begins with a literal '1'.  The <cost center stack code> and the
-- <call count>, <tick count> and <alloc count> are all integers. The end
-- of the profiling data is indicated by a literal '0'.
--
-- So what's a cost center and what is a cost center stack?  A cost center
-- is simply a section of code to which costs are attributed.  It is
-- often a function, but source code annotations can be used to divide
-- a function into several cost centers.
--
-- For the purpose of understanding the profiling file format, a cost
-- center stack is just a cost center and its calling cost center.
-- Costs --- call counts, ticks spent executing and allocations --- are
-- sttributed to call center stacks.  This means, for example, that if
-- both function_1 and function_2 call map, the costs of map will be
-- in two call center stacks, one with function_1 as the parent of
-- map, and another with function_2 as its parent.  In essence, a
-- call center stack can be thought of as an _edge_ of the call graph,
-- while the cost centers themselves are the nodes.
--
-- Note that the <cost center stack code> may not be unique.  This can
-- happen, for instance,  if there are mutually recursive cost centers.
-- In that case costs, while attributable to a particular node (cost center)
-- can't be attributed to a specific edge (cost center stack).
--
-- Parsing the profile returns a data structure called a ProfileGraph.
-- This is an IntMap keyed by <cost center number>.  The entries in the
-- map are records giving the name of the cost center and the module to
-- which it belongs, and an incidence list giving the nodes that call
-- this cost center and the costs associated with each.
--
-- Note that the conversion from call tree (in which each cost center
-- can appear multiple times) to call graph (where each cost center
-- appears only once) is implicitly done as part of the generation of
-- the ProfileGraph record.
